# Approach
Started with Exploratory Data Analysis.  

       * Data is imbalanced.
       * Data visualization.
       * Categorize features as binary , ordinal , one_hot, numerical.
       
Did some Feature Engineering / Feature Selection  

       * Used VIF to check for multicollinearity and removed using RFE.
       * Used SMOTE to balance the dataset

Modelling  

       * Applied different models and XGBoost stands out with 82 % f1 score.
